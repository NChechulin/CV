	{In this project, I researched the applicability of classical HFT pairs strategies on Moscow Stock Exchange. The project used an industry-grade backtester with Limit Order Book data, real-world latencies and commissions. Also, I suggested an improvement to the base algorithm, resulting in greater profitability and smoother equity plot.}

	{I coded a custom physics engine and trained an RL agent to swing up the pole. This involved implementation of several RL algorithms from scratch, but we stopped on DDPG, since it showed the best performance with regard to training time.}
